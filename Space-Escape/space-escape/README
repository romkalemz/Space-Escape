Overview:
	This game is called Space Escape where you control a spaceship who's main goal is
	to kill as many enemies (up to 30 to pass the level) and collect attachment powerups
	that strengthen the player throughout the level. The game contains 3 different types
	of enemies that vary in strength and uniqueness. The game in its prototype only contains
	two unique levels and only three different enemies. Future plans are to continue
	developing for this game introducing a boss, different animations for the player
	and enemies as well as displaying the attachments gained from the orbs to display
	on the player.
